What our project is going to be is a forum where people can make topics
and anyone can add to it with comments.
This will contain a minimum:
a main page for the topics
different pages for each topic
a delete button for the comments/topic
a form for each page

What we would like to add is:
a login and registation
user deleting their own submits
admin logic for control of everything


(Project never got off the ground due to communcation problems)
